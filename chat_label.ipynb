    "# 🧪 LLM-based Information Extraction from Real Estate Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of **20 conversational transcripts** between property buyers and real estate agents.  \n",
    "These conversations are informal, multi-turn, and intentionally noisy, reflecting real-world interactions where information may be incomplete, implicit, or ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each conversation potentially contains details such as buyer identity, budget, location preferences, visit dates, profession, and buying timeline.  \n",
    "A **manually curated gold label set** was created for each conversation to enable systematic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting structured information from conversational text is challenging due to missing fields, implicit references, and the risk of hallucination by LLMs.  \n",
    "Unlike form-based inputs, conversational data requires careful handling to avoid incorrect inference while maintaining schema consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to evaluate how effectively **prompt engineering strategies** enable large language models to extract structured entities from conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we aim to:\n",
    "- Compare multiple prompting approaches\n",
    "- Measure extraction quality using precision, recall, and F1 score\n",
    "- Analyze model and entity-level failure modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on **prompt design over model size**, reflecting practical constraints in real-world information extraction systems.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the experimental results, **Llama-3.1-8B** emerges as the most reliable model for conversational information extraction. It consistently achieved the **highest precision and F1 scores** while exhibiting **significantly fewer false positives**, indicating strong schema adherence and reduced hallucination behavior compared to Allam-7B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among prompt strategies, **null-bias and strict prompts** delivered the best overall performance. These prompts effectively constrained the model from inferring missing information, resulting in higher precision and more stable structured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Allam-7B** demonstrated higher hallucination rates across most prompt types, particularly when exposed to complex or constraint-heavy instructions. However, when paired with a **zero-shot prompt**, Allam-7B showed the **lowest hallucination levels**, making it a reasonable fallback option in **token-constrained or low-compute scenarios**, albeit with lower extraction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings reinforce that **prompt discipline is critical for controlling hallucinations**, and that **stronger instruction-following models benefit more from constraint-based prompting**, while simpler prompts may be better suited for smaller or less robust models.\n"
